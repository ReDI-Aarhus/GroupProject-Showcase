*This is a draft how to showcase group projects for S7 students - still in construction*

## Introduction:
Welcome to ReDI School's Group Project Showcase! We are here to celebrate creativity, highlight different approaches to solving problems and inspire new ideas for learning and development. These examples are meant to spark curiosity and help others understand concepts in Python and how they can be applied to ideas in the real-world.

 This is an attempt to use this Repository as the main parentproject, while hosting submodules (alumni's repository). 

### ðŸ“¦ What are Git Submodules?
A submodule is like a linked repo inside another repo. The main repo (called the parentproject) keeps track of which commit of the submodule is being used, but doesn't copy the submodule's history into itself. 

## Objectives
We aim to collect and showcase alumni's repositories in this parent repository in a structured way by year, season, and project name. Each year alumnis are welcome to add their project at the end of each semester.

## Purpose
This is a space to share code and explore other types of projects. Comments are welcome to give feedback or open more discussions about relevant topics. The purpose of this repository is to learn and improve collaboration among developers. 

## ðŸ“Œ Important Note!
Before adding your submodule, read the following:
- [GUIDLINES.md](GUIDLINES.md)
- [CONTRIBUTING.md ](CONTRIBUTING.md)
