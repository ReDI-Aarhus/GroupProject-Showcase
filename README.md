*This is a draft how to showcase group projects for S7 students - still in construction*

## Introduction:
Welcome to ReDI School's Group Project Showcase! We are here to celebrate creativity, highlight different approaches to solving problems and inspire new ideas for learning and development. These examples are meant to spark curiosity and help others understand concepts in several foundational codes like Python, Javascript, CSS etc.. They could also cover several topics such as Data Analytics, UX/UI Design, Cybersecurity and more. 

> ðŸ“¦ What is a Git Submodule? <br> 
A Git submodule is like a linked repo inside another repo. The main repo (called the parentproject) keeps track of which commit of the submodule is being used, but doesn't copy the submodule's history into itself. 

We aim to collect and showcase alumni's repositories in this parent repository at the end of each semester. The purpose of this repository is to learn and improve collaboration among developers. 

## ðŸ“Œ Important Note!
Before adding your submodule, read the following:
- [GUIDLINES.md](GUIDLINES.md)
- [CONTRIBUTING.md ](CONTRIBUTING.md)

âœ¨ Take a stroll through our [Courses Folder](Courses) to discover the amazing work of our contributorsâ€”each project is neatly organized as a submodule!

ðŸ’¬ We welcome thoughtful, respectful feedback and encourage positive discussion. Feel free to leave comments in the discussions tab and join the conversation on any project!
